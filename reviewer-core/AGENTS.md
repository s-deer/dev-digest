# reviewer-core (`@devdigest/reviewer-core`) — agent notes

**npm, not pnpm.** This package has its own `package-lock.json`.

## Commands

```sh
npm test           # vitest, hermetic, stubbed LLMProvider — no keys, no network
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit — this IS the build; the package emits no JS
```

## Conventions

- **Purity is the contract.** No database, no GitHub, no filesystem. The only
  side effect is an LLM call through an **injected** `LLMProvider`. Anything
  that needs I/O belongs in `server/`, not here.
- Consumed as TypeScript source through a tsconfig path alias. Never add a
  build step or import from `dist`.
- The public surface is whatever `src/index.ts` exports. Adding an export is
  an API change; check `server/` consumers first.
- Contracts (`Review`, `Finding`, `Verdict`, …) come from `@devdigest/shared`.
- Untrusted content (diffs, PR bodies) must be fenced with `wrapUntrusted()` +
  `INJECTION_GUARD` before it reaches the prompt.

## Gotchas

- **The grounding gate is mandatory.** A finding that does not cite a real
  line in the diff is dropped. Do not add a bypass — it is what stops
  hallucinated locations.
- The score is **recomputed deterministically** from the surviving findings.
  The model's own score is never trusted.
- `assemblePrompt` accepts optional slots (`skills`, `memory`, `specs`,
  `callers`) that the starter does not fill. Omitted slots render as no
  section — an empty section in the prompt means a caller passed an empty
  value.

## Read when

- Read `specs/`, `docs/`, and `INSIGHTS.md` first for what's already
  intended, documented, or tried here. Record non-obvious findings with the
  `engineering-insights` skill.
- Read `README.md` for the pipeline diagram and the full public API.
- Read `../docs/agent-prompts/` when the task concerns a built-in agent's
  system prompt or model choice.
